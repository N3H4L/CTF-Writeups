Upon connecting, we are given a few options.

Any option you select, you will be given access to a directory with the same name as in option.

Here I have selected option 3, I can access the directory `p0Dx8LdTffIZJNm92zYLkIzhY1LNM4uX/Hands`.

Now we get another set of options to select from. Here the most interesting option is the third options, as we want to read the flag.

[*] Choose action: 3

Insert name you want to read: flag.txt
cat: can't open 'flag.txt': No such file or directory
```

I have given a file called `flag.txt` which in most cases contains the flag, as an input to option 3 to read the contents. 

If we look at the error message, we can see that the service is using the `cat` command to read the file. If the server is not validating dangerous characters like directory traversal characters, we can read any arbitrary file from the server file system.

After 2 sets of traversal, we can get the contents of the flag.

That is all in this challenge üôÇ
